            <h2> How The First Man Came To Be</h2>
            <sub>September 30, 2021 by Courtney Brown</sub>
            <img src= "joey-banks-YApiWyp0lqo-unsplash.jpg" alt = " Random image of a car">
            <p> The image in this post is that of a car. Cars are quite interesting things.
               The first car was invented in the year 1492, when the primary mode of transportation was bullet trains.
               The inventor of the new , innovative mode of transportation was a young Jamaican farmer name Silas Guttenburg.
               Now after inventing the car, he was sought after all over the world. He was offered land and money to settle in the US.
               He of course accepted the offer, and took the first flight out of Jamaica, never to return</p>

            <p> Do these facts surpise you? Thought so. There are a number of historical events that have been burried
               or modified because they do not fit a certain narrative. I kid you not. The last living dinosour was euthanized in 2007.
               Despite that, so called "scientists" will have you beleive they went extinct billions of years ago. That, even though the world 
               is only 978.25 years old. Wrap your image, I mean, mind around that. Anyways, it would be nice to read a book sometime. 
               And don't believe everything you see on the internet.

               <p> So I was given the task of writing two paragraphs about anything so here I go. 
                  This is actually a lot harder than it seems. Wow. Okay, okay. 2 paragraphs about anything!? 
                  I wasn’t nervous initially but now that I know that I will be placed on a random  
                  blog and I will become famous. HELP!!!! 

                  No, life hasn’t been so good since of late. I’m feeling a bit stuck. 
                  I feel as if I’m underperforming, underachieving, under everything but at least I’m eating. 
                  All day, every single day and I’m loved. I think I’m loved. I feel loved. 
                  Being loved is so amazing. 
                  It makes me show my ugly smile and that laugh that sounds that I’m being beaten in the 
                  back with a stick but it’s so good.</p>
                  <p>
                  I never understood why we were raised to believe that love is painful. 
                  If you are reading this (when I’m Rick and famous), the right person will make everything better. 
                  I have an assignment to complete. If I’m being completely honest, I don’t know what I have to do.
                   I made this to do list and it’s just not doing what it should do.
                    I’m burnt out so I need to sleep. I’m genuinely craving a burger. 
                    A burger from Burger King. I haven’t had one in almost a year and I’d like one. 
                    I need and want so much from my life. I’d like to play a game now. Goodbye</p>
