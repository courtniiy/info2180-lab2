            <h2> How The First Man Came To Be</h2>
            <sub>September 30, 2021 by Courtney Brown</sub>
            <img src= "joey-banks-YApiWyp0lqo-unsplash.jpg" alt = " Random image of a car">
            <p> The image in this post is that of a car. Cars are quite interesting things.
               The first car was invented in the year 1492, when the primary mode of transportation was bullet trains.
               The inventor of the new , innovative mode of transportation was a young Jamaican farmer name Silas Guttenburg.
               Now after inventing the car, he was sought after all over the world. He was offered land and money to settle in the US.
               He of course accepted the offer, and took the first flight out of Jamaica, never to return</p>

            <p> Do these facts surpise you? Thought so. There are a number of historical events that have been burried
               or modified because they do not fit a certain narrative. I kid you not. The last living dinosour was euthanized in 2007.
               Despite that, so called "scientists" will have you beleive they went extinct billions of years ago. That, even though the world 
               is only 978.25 years old. Wrap your image, I mean, mind around that. Anyways, it would be nice to read a book sometime. 
               And don't believe everything you see on the internet.
